    ### Contents ###

Here are the workspaces used by Alessandro Lussana for the development of
bpnet-related projects.

Current project involves the adaptation of bpnet to be used with the
integration of ATAC-seq data and TF binding sites data.
The adapted framework is being used to analyze the chromatin accessibility of
the samples in the Tampere Prostate Cancer Dataset.

Relevant data and code is in bpnet_model_training/

    ### Backup ###

Parts of the code are pushed on github:
https://github.com/alussana/tampere_pc_bpnet

Directories currently backed up are:
* bpnet_model_training/local/

    ### Notes ###

Due to persistent Lustre issues, on 2020-06-22 this directory was copied from
/lustre/bmt-data/genomics/projects/lussana

The workspaces have evolved since then.
At /lustre/bmt-data/genomics/projects/lussana there still are the old
workspaces.
