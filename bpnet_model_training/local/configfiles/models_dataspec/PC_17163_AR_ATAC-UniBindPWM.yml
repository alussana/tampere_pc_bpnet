  #task_name:
    #tracks:
      # List of bigwig files (1 or more) corresponding to the task
      # The model will predict each track individually (here coverage of
      # reads mapping to the positive and negative strand) and
      # the contribution scores will be averaged across all of these tracks
    #peaks: Peaks associated with the task(optional)
